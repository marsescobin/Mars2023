    <h1>Halved support tickets through a dashboard revamp</h1>
    <p>
      I noticed the quality of our support tickets was bad. Most of it was
      centered around pay - an effective way to churn a user. After crunching
      the numbers, conducting interviews and reading more tickets, I realized
      our communication around pay needs to be more transparent, visible and
      clear.  I got a team together and we built a dashboard that breaks down
      payment very transparently. We made it visible by displaying this
      dashboard in the assistants’ portal. We also sent a copy to their emails.
      The product design made the breakdown very clear.  The result - on our
      first release, we slashed the number of support tickets in half.
