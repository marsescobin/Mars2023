    <h1>Reduced onboarding time from weeks to minutes</h1>

    <p>
      Our onboarding time sucked. We were building a marketplace for virtual
      assistants and it was taking two weeks to get them to sign their contract.
      The result - we couldn't deposit their payment in time. After raking
      through the payment escalations and talking to assistants, it became clear
      where the process was breaking down- multiple manual touch points: from
      contract creation to contract signing. It's a silly problem to have. And
      one that should be easy to solve. The problem was our payment and
      compliance provider at the time, Deel, didn't have a public API yet and
      we've been in their waitlist for a year. Finally, I did what any impatient
      product manager would do. I emailed their product team directly and
      brought up our use case. To my surprise, they responded and we immediately
      set up a meeting. We put together a team and I lead the project on our
      end, I worked with a counter-PM on Deel's. After the collab, we got our
      contract signing process automated and our users happy. Our onboarding
      time now reduced from weeks to minutes, less support tickets and 50 hours
      a month saved on HR admin time. Deel created a case study about it here:
