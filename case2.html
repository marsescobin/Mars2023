        Great PMs endlessly look for blockers to unblock.
        <br></br> They’re always on the
        hunt for bottlenecks, unmade decisions, and anything that is keeping their
        team from operating like a well-oiled machine.

      In any marketplace, efficient onboarding is crucial. And this was our problem.
      We were registering days, sometimes weeks of onboarding time beacause of contract signing delays.
      <br></br>
      The root cause is the cumbersome, manual process of contract creation and signing.
      Our existing payment and compliance provider at the time, Deel, lacked a public API which meant we couldn't automate it. 
      And we've been sitting on their private beta waitlist for a while now. 
      <br></br>
     What’s a product manager to do? Wait patiently? Not quite my style. 
     Instead, I reached out directly to Deel’s product team and brought our use case to light. To my delight, they immediately responded
     and we set up a productive meeting. I paired up with a counter PM from their side and in a few weeks time, streamlined the contract signing process. 
     <br></br>
     Results? Inspiring:
     <br></br>
     Onboarding? Down from weeks to minutes.
     <br></br>
     Support tickets? Plummeted.
     <br></br>
     Support time? Saved 50 hours each month.
