      Before the dashboard revamp,  users were confused.  
      They didn't quite understand how payment works, when they will get paid or why there was an adjustment on it. 
      A bulk of the questions came from new users and most of it have already been answered on our FAQs. 
      In fact there's plenty of information about it, but it was apparent that our communication lacked clarity, transparency and visibility.

      <br>
       I wouldn't have known this if I didn't talk to users.. or raked through the support tickets. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I got a team together to build a new dashboard. 
      The design took many iterations, testing, and back and forth with some of the users I was talking to. 
      <br>
      <br>
      But by the end of it - we were proud of the the results we got- our payment related tickets went down 50% on our first release.
